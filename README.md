# My Travel Journal

## Description
This site reads the travel destinations from an array of objects located in file data.js - each object representing a travel destination. React JSX elements are dynamically created from the array to be presented on the page. A Google Maps link is provided for each destination.

The actual content is from some of my own travels.
