# My Travel Journal

## Description
This site is an implementation of Data-driven React. It reads the travel destinations from an array of objects located in file data.js - Each object represents a travel destination. React JSX elements are created from the array and then presented on the page. 

A Google Maps link is provided for each destination.

The actual content is from my own travels.
